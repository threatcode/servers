# Security Policy

Thank you for helping keep the Model Context Protocol and its ecosystem secure.

## Important Notice

The servers in this repository are **reference implementations** intended to demonstrate
MCP features and SDK usage. They serve as educational examples for developers building
their own MCP servers, not as production-ready solutions.

This repository is **not** eligible for security vulnerability reporting. If you discover
a vulnerability in an MCP SDK, please report it in the appropriate SDK repository.

## Reporting Security Issues in MCP SDKs

If you discover a security vulnerability in an MCP SDK, please report it through the
[GitHub Security Advisory process](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability)
in the relevant SDK repository.

Please **do not** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions,
or pull requests.
